# Musement Test by Marcos GoÃ±alons

## Needed tools
In order to run the app, only Docker is necessary.

There is no need to have PHP or composer installed in the local machine, since everything happens inside the Docker container.

You can check how to install Docker in your machine here -> https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/

If you don't want to use Docker, you'll need to install  
- PHP 8 
- php-mbstring extension
- php-zip extension
- php-xdebug extension
- composer

## Setup
```
git clone git@github.com:marcos-gonalons/musement_test_php.git
```
After cloning the repository, we need to build the docker image with the following command

```
make build
```

This will take a couple of minutes. It will also install all the composer dependencies inside the image.

When the build it's done, we can run the app with the following command:
```
make run
```

This command will execute the script and you should start seeing in the console output the "Processed city x | weather today - weather tomorrow" messages :)  

Under the hood is running this command **"php bin/console 'app:get-forecasts'"** inside the docker container.


## Other commands

**make phpstan**  
This command is for running the phpstan static analyzer, with the highest possible level (https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan).  
Runs **"vendor/bin/phpstan --level=8 analyse src/"** inside the docker container.

  
**make sniff**  
To run the PHP_CodeSniffer (https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer).  
Runs **"vendor/bin/phpcs --standard=PSR12 src/"** inside the docker container.

**make sniff-fix**  
To fix the autofixable errors found by phpcs.  
Runs **"vendor/bin/phpcbf --standard=PSR12 src/"** inside the docker container.

**make tests**  
For running the tests (100% of the code is covered).  
Runs **"vendor/bin/phpunit"** inside the docker container


**make tests-coverage**  
Runs the tests and generates the coverage report, which will be found in the "coverage" folder.  
Runs **php -d xdebug.mode=coverage vendor/bin/phpunit --coverage-html coverage --whitelist src** inside the docker container.


## Implementation
Symfony 5 and PHP 8 were used for this project.  

The code follows the PSR12 coding style standard, and is structured as follows:  


**src/Command**  
Contains the command that will be executed.  
The command's single responsibility is to call the ForecastService, and to output the error if
the ForecastService threw an error.  

**src/Service/Forecast**  
Contains the ForecastService.  
The ForecastService responsibility is to hold the business logic.  
It has the weather api and the cities api as dependencies, and it will call them in order to get the forecasts for all the cities.  


**src/Service/API**  
Contains both the Musement Cities API and the Weather API.  
The responsibility of the API services is to make the HTTP calls and to validate the responses.

## APIs implementation
Each API has it's own ResponseValidator, URL and HTTP client library as dependencies.  
The weather API also has the API KEY as a dependency.  
The URLs and the API KEY are defined in the .env file.

As the HTTP Client library I decided to use Guzzle HTTP since it's very easy to work with.  

When receiving the response from the API, I use the JsonMapper (https://github.com/cweiske/jsonmapper) for mapping the json response into php objects.  
Thanks to this package I don't have to do it manually.  
We just need to create the classes that will hold the data and the mapper takes care of everything.


## Error handling
When something unexpected happens (for example the API responds with a 500, or the response is not the one we are expecting), an exception will be thrown and it will be catched by the try-catch block done at the top-level, located in src/Command/ForecastCommand.php.  
Then the error will be displayed in the console.



## Possible improvements
Right now, getting the weather information for each city is done in sync mode.  
This means that it will not call the weather api to get the info for the next city until the current call has finished.  
We could improve the speed by making the weather api calls asynchronously.  
For example, instead of making only 1 call every time, we could group them in groups of 10, so we could do 10 concurrent requests to the weather API, and printing the result in STDOUT as we get the responses.  
Guzzle supports async requests, so this is something totally possible :) (https://docs.guzzlephp.org/en/stable/quickstart.html#concurrent-requests)



## .env file
Here I added 3 environment variables:  

*WEATHER_API_KEY=5f3f1e14e8784c708b6185059200812*
*WEATHER_API_URL=http://api.weatherapi.com/v1/forecast.json*  
*CITIES_API_URL=https://api.musement.com/api/v3/cities*  

Secrets and passwords, like the weather api key, should not be commited in .env files.  
I decided to leave it there since it's a free key.  
You can use that one or you can change it with your own api key.
